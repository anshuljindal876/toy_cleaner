To run the vision demo as seen in the presentation slides, use the following:

First,
ros2 launch capstone_vision_env simulation.launch.py 

Then,
ros2 launch capstone_vision camera_reading_demo.launch.py 

This was made with ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS.
OpenCV will need to be installed in order to run.
